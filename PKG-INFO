Description: ========================
        sc.base.memberdataexport
        ========================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        A very common request of customers is to give them a listing of registered users
        in theirs portals and sites. Althought, as PlonePAS allows us to deploy different
        user and properties sources, even the most simple case -- Plone factory settings
        -- is not covered when we need to export user data.
        
        This package aims to solve, at least, the simple use cases, allowing portal managers
        to export member data (except password) on a CSV format.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To use this package, on a buildout based installation:
        
        1. Unpack sc.base.memberdataexport package to src/ folder of your buildout
        
        2. Edit your buildout.cfg and add the following information::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
        sc.base.memberdataexport
        
        [instance]
        zcml =
        ...
        sc.base.memberdataexport
        
        The last line tells buildout to generate a zcml snippet that tells
        Zope to configure sc.base.memberdataexport.
        
        If another package depends on the sc.base.memberdataexport egg or
        includes its zcml directly you do not need to specify anything in the
        buildout configuration: buildout will detect this automatically.
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'',
        which will take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in the Plone interface and click on the
        'Add/Remove Products' link.
        
        Choose the product (check its checkbox) and click the 'Install' button.
        
        Uninstall -- This can be done from the same management screen, but only
        if you installed it from the quick installer.
        
        Note: You may have to empty your browser cache to see the effects of the
        product installation.
